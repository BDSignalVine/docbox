## Introduction

The Signal Vine API enables clients to integrate their systems/applications with Signal Vine. The API provides access to your data via HTTPS. 

We follow a RESTful approach, using standard HTTP verbs and HATEOAS links. To make resource requests, you need to create a token and a secret. They are used to sign requests so they can be authorized and authenticated. 

Contact support to sign up for the beta program and retrieve a token and secret for use with your account.
